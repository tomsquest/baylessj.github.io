   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iris1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image keyboard photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever in search of the best keyboard, I recently embarked on the journey of
hand wiring a keyboard. I had been using a &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/09/16/hotdox-review.html&quot;&gt;Hot Dox&lt;/a&gt;
keyboard for the better part of the last year and liked it for the most part. The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ergodox-ez.com/&quot;&gt;Ergodox&lt;/a&gt; layout had two main issues for my uses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was large and had too many keys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the thumb cluster wasn’t within easy reach for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only ever used the two “2u” sized thumb keys so the rest of the thumb cluster 
just served to get in the way. The keys on the inside-most column of the 5x7 
layout were nice to use sometimes (I had them mapped to brackets and parentheses)
but they were a decent stretch so I didn’t use them often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered the plates for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard&quot;&gt;Iris Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;
when rummaging through some spare keyboard parts. The
Iris is also a split, ortholinear keyboard like the Hot Dox and Ergodox but has 
a 4x6 grid with only 4 thumb keys. The resulting desk footprint of the Iris is 
considerably smaller than the Ergodox while still remaining fully functional. 
In my opinion, the thumb cluster is more ergonomically designed and actually
allows for all four of the keys to be used rather than just two on the Ergodox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major hurdle for me was the extreme DIY nature of hand wiring the keyboard.
The Hot Dox was incredibly easy to build by comparison, I didn’t have to break 
out the soldering iron once for that kit. That being said, building the Iris 
gave me a much better understanding of how the keyboard and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.qmk.fm/#/&quot;&gt;QMK&lt;/a&gt;
work. Overall I would recommend the experience but it’s definitely not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-build&quot;&gt;The Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that I needed the following materials to build the Iris:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Top and Bottom plates for each side (part of the kit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standoffs + screws for attaching the plates (part of the kit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;56 switches, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-silent-red.html&quot;&gt;Cherry MX Silent Reds&lt;/a&gt; for the grid and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-special/mx-clear.html&quot;&gt;Cherry MX Clears&lt;/a&gt; for the thumb clusters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;56 diodes, any can do but 1N4148s are cheap and easy to find&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640&quot;&gt;Pro Micro&lt;/a&gt; microcontrollers, one for each side&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some ribbon cables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some thicker (22 AWG or so) wire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 SPST switches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideally some sort of 4 wire cable and 2 connectors, but I didn’t use that. More on that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assembling-the-matrix&quot;&gt;Assembling the Matrix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iris2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image keyboard matrix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A keyboard tells the computer which key was pressed by sending a logic state “0”
on the pins that correspond to its position. This requires two electrical
characteristics – pressing the switch must close a circuit to send a “0” instead
of “1” like it would normally and there must be some way to locate what switch 
was pressed. We identify the key’s location by creating a “matrix” where each 
key lies on a column and a row. Each key in a given column is wired together and
each key on a given row is wired together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each key needs its own diode connected to its row to ensure that other key presses
don’t interfere with this key’s ability to send its location. The writeup on 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/&quot;&gt;Komar’s Techblog&lt;/a&gt; 
goes more into detail about how this matrix design allows for n-key rollover, 
or NKRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the approach where the legs of the diode for the row wiring and found it 
to be good solution. The diode legs are not insulated so I used insulating wires
for the rest of the build to ensure that I would not short out anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;matrix-meet-micro&quot;&gt;Matrix, Meet Micro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iris3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image keyboard micro connections&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the matrix is wired up, each row and each column need connected to a GPIO 
pin on the microcontroller. I used Pro Micro controllers for each side of the 
keyboard. It is possible to avoid using two micros with some complicated wiring 
but I found that it was much easier to use a dedicated micro for each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ribbon cable made this step much cleaner than it would have been with the 
thicker wire I used for the matrix. In addition to easily organizing the cable 
on the edge of the keys the ribbon cable folded over on itself very nicely when
attaching the bottom plate. The Iris is not a very thick keyboard so there was
not much additional depth left between the micro and the switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;important-note&quot;&gt;Important Note&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake on this step of the wiring on my first attempt. It is quite 
convenient to use the legs of the switches as a joint where wires will connect 
and be soldered together, but this does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; work for the row connections. 
I had originally soldered my row connections to the row-side leg of one of the
switches, but that prevented the other keys on the row from sending presses.
This is because the key’s diode was preventing current from flowing from the other 
switches to the row connection. I moved the solder joint for the row connections
to one of the diode legs and everything worked nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-the-gap&quot;&gt;Bridging the Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides each have their own microcontroller so they can work on their own
but we need them to talk to the computer through just one side. The two sides can 
either use “soft serial” comms over three wires to talk to each other or they
can talk over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C&quot;&gt;I2C&lt;/a&gt; with four wires.  &lt;br /&gt;
I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cablechick.com.au/blog/understanding-trrs-and-audio-jacks/&quot;&gt;TRRS&lt;/a&gt; cable and associated 
jacks sitting around so I opted to use I2C over its four wires. The jacks that I
had were incredibly snug fitting on the cable though, and I ended up with a whole 
bunch of issues getting a connection between the two sides. The TRRS cable seems
like a better option in general compared to alternatives like an RJ45 cable or 
similar but my hardware was not so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dealing with issues with my TRRS setup for a few hours I decided to cut 
my losses and solder the wires for the two sides together. This is certainly
not the most reliable or prettiest option but it was an easy option for the time.
I’m planning to order some more TRRS jacks and another cable in the future so I
can transport the two sides individually if I need to and make the board look
less like a skunkworks project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reset-switch&quot;&gt;Reset Switch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iris_reset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image reset button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot about this until I went to flash some firmware onto the board; I’d
recommend taking care of this with the rest of the wiring. I used a momentary
SPST switch from my old college EE lab kit for each side. One leg gets a connection 
to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt; and one of the other two legs gets a connection to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; on the Pro Micro.
I had to play with the wiring a bit to figure out which of the legs was the normally 
open connection and which one was normally closed to ensure that the reset only
occurs when the switch is pressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After wiring it up I used a piece of double sided adhesive foam to attach it 
to the top plate near the thumb cluster. You can see a bit of it in the header
photo for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qmk-config&quot;&gt;QMK Config&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the customization possibilities with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.qmk.fm/#/&quot;&gt;QMK&lt;/a&gt; on my Hot Dox and it was 
the clear choice for my Iris build. The Iris is already supported by QMK but
the configuration is intended for an Iris that uses a PCB rather than a hand-wired
clone like mine. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baylessj/qmk_firmware&quot;&gt;forked QMK on github&lt;/a&gt;
and started making my own modified version of the Iris QMK configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;describing-the-wiring&quot;&gt;Describing the Wiring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to getting the Iris up and running was defining the wiring in the 
QMK config header. I chose the pins that made the most sense for the geometry of 
my handwired build but that, unsurprisingly, did not match the pins used on the 
PCB version of the Iris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One source of confusion for me in this step was the fact that each pin on the 
Pro Micro has a multitude of names. The identifiers used by QMK are the Arduino 
pin names rather than the names shown on the physical board or its wiring diagram.
These names are copied below. The top of the diagram is where the micro-USB
connector lies on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; Pro Micro Pinout:

     D3 +--------+ RAW
     D2 | +----+ | GND
     GND|        | RST
     GND|        | VCC
SDA  D1 |        | F4
SCL  D0 |        | F5
     D4 |        | F6
     C6 |        | F7
     D7 |        | B1
     E6 |        | B3
     B4 |        | B2
     B5 +--------+ B6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I copied the files from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;qmk_firmware/keyboards/keebio/iris/rev4&lt;/code&gt;
(the latest keyboard revision at the time of writing) to a new folder in the same 
parent directory that I called “Handwire”. I changed these files to match my keyboard’s 
wiring and set this layout as my keyboard type with the QMK CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pins for the matrix wiring are defined with the following lines in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define MATRIX_ROW_PINS        { B1, F7, F6, F5, F4 }
#define MATRIX_COL_PINS        { B3, B2, B6, E6, B4, B5 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The row pins are ordered from the top (furthest from the wrist) down and the 
column pins are ordered from the inside (thumb side) out for the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;split-keyboard-things&quot;&gt;Split Keyboard Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the split keyboard-specific QMK configuration details were handled already
by the Iris files that I reused, but there were two items that I had to define 
in my &lt;strong&gt;keymap&lt;/strong&gt;. This involved a different &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt; file than the previously
mentioned wiring config, this file was in a keymap directory that I created rather 
than in the “Handwire” layout config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I defined the following two macros in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;keymaps/&amp;lt;MY_USER_NAME&amp;gt;/config.h&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;USE_I2C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MASTER_RIGHT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These macros tell QMK that I am using I2C over four wires to communicate between 
the sides of the keyboard and that I will always plug the keyboard in to my
computer by way of the micro on the right hand side. There are other configuration 
options available for determining the master side but I found that it was easiest
to just stick with the right side permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keymap&quot;&gt;Keymap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to transfer my Hot Dox keyboard layout without a ton of modifications 
because I was pretty much only using 56 keys on the Hot Dox anyways. The top row
was where I most noticed the more cramped layout of the Iris but I was able to 
resolve that issue with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KC_GESC&lt;/code&gt; key macro in QMK. This allows me wrap the 
grave key and the escape key into one all on the same layer. I then rearranged
the number row a bit so that it is in order from 0-9 rather than 1-9 followed by 0.
This kept the numbers, and more importantly, their symbols, in the same position
that I was used to on the Hot Dox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view my current keymap for my Iris board in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baylessj/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/baylessj/keymap.c&quot;&gt;my fork of QMK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fixing a soft-bricked Logitech Receiver with fwupdmgr</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/03/bricked-mx-master-receiver.html"/>
   <updated>2020-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/03/bricked-mx-master-receiver</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was very excited for the 20.04 LTS release of &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pop!_OS&lt;/a&gt; that came out a few
days ago. The addition of automatic window tiling and the various GNOME improvements
that came with the update were well worth the move from 19.10. After a few days
of using the update I still stand by my opinion that the upgrade was worthwhile,
but it wasn’t an easy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, the 20.04 upgrade with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pop-upgrade&lt;/code&gt; didn’t like the configuration
of my computer’s hard-drives in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; – but that’s understandable given
that there’s three drives and a mix on windows partitions on the non-boot ones.
A fresh install took care of that issue, and all of the drives are accessible
and running fine now. I did not, however, expect that my &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Logitech MX MAster 2S&lt;/a&gt;
mouse would fall victim to the upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way in the fresh install of Pop!_OS 20.04, the firmware update
manager utility decided to run. This utility decided that the firmware for the
Logitech Unifying Receiver, the USB dongle for the mouse, needed updating. That
would have been fine, except the update encountered an “unexpected error” and cut
out half-way through the update. This left the mouse dongle unusable and the 
mouse refused to connect to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick check of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lsusb | grep Logitech&lt;/code&gt; gave me &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bus 003 Device 005: ID 046d:aaac Logitech, Inc. USB BootLoader&lt;/code&gt; where the dongle was plugged in. This was good news in that the dongle
was still communicating over USB and was not hard-bricked, but it clearly isn’t 
supposed to be a “BootLoader” device. The Pop!_OS firmware upgrade utility in 
the Settings menu didn’t show that the device was eligible for an upgrade, but I
assumed that somehow forcing an update would improve the situation. Thankfully I
was introduced to the command line version of the update tool from a Stack Overflow
post. Running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fwupdmgr update&lt;/code&gt; turned out to be the solution, it correctly
identified that the “USB BootLoader” device was supposed to be a Logitech Receiver
and got it updated. It took a minute to run the upgrade and once it finished I was
able to connect the mouse to the receiver again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading to Pop!_OS 20.04 was a tumultuous journey for my mouse, but it introduced
me to the more powerful command line version of the firmware upgrade utility.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vimwiki + Zettelkasten -- Note Taking Nirvana</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/09/zettelkasten-vimwiki.html"/>
   <updated>2020-03-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/09/zettelkasten-vimwiki</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in a time of turmoil with note taking and text editing. I bounced around
between a few different editors before landing on Vim full-time. I experimented
with a &lt;a href=&quot;gitbook.com&quot;&gt;gitbook&lt;/a&gt;, I used &lt;a href=&quot;joplinapp.org&quot;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; for a bit, and I wrote a lot down on paper
and post-it notes. As much as I love using pen and paper, I need to take notes
on a computer to ensure that they’ll be with me everywhere. I looked for a way
to keep my notes in one place and, ideally, in one file. The &lt;strong&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/strong&gt;
method fit that bill exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/strong&gt; is a German word that means “slip box”. It’s a note taking
method invented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann&quot;&gt;Niklas Luhmann&lt;/a&gt;, a German Sociologist. Luhmann
wrote an impressive number of papers throughout his career using the Zettelkasten
method to collect his notes. His Zettelkasten was a physical box containing slips
of paper where he wrote his notes, hence the name. He stored every note he took as a slip in his Zettelkasten, creating a “second brain” of sorts that mirrored his knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luhmann’s own Zettelkasten defines the method. The fundamental tenets of the
method are derived from his approach. As mentioned before, Luhmann had only one
Zettelkasten throughout his entire life. Keeping these notes in one place
allowed him to accurately mirror his whole set of knowledge – including the
convoluted associations between knowledge that seems separate at first glance.
He was able to reference lessons learned from his early career even in his last
writings. I, and many others today, choose to implement this idea by having one
Zettelkasten digital file rather than a physical box. It is easy to edit files
of a considerable size with Vim so there is no real worry of needing to split the Zettelkasten files up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a sense of structure, a single file full of a life’s work would become
impossible to navigate. The Zettelkasten method specifies that each slip should
have a unique ID value, like a key in a database. This ID value is used to
reference the slip from other notes in the future. Inter-note references can span
years and numerous subjects in between, so long as there is reason to mention one
in the context of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be unreasonable to explicitly link to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; related note once the
Zettelkasten grows large, so a loose tree structure is recommended. There is no
formal requirement for choosing ID values, except that they should be unique, but
I prefer to organize notes somewhat hierarchically. A general note about Agile
meetings would get a high-level ID like #1a and a detailed note about timeboxing
Scrum standups would be nested below it as #1a1a1a. Each alternation between
alphabetical and numerical characters indicates a level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially wrote my Zettelkasten in a plain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; file using a rough markdown
syntax. This was manageable until my Zettelkasten file grew to about 1000 lines,
and then it became a bit of a pain to navigate between linked notes. At this point
I turned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimwiki.github.io/&quot;&gt;Vimwiki&lt;/a&gt; to get the linking infrastructure for my Zettelkasten.
Vimwiki does a lot beyond the linking support that I am using it for, but I will
focus primarily on that subset of features here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each note in my Zettelkasten receives a unique ID of the form “1a1a1” and is listed
as a second level header in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zettelkasten.wiki&lt;/code&gt; file. It is then easy
to link to any other note in the Zettelkasten by adding a Vimwiki link to the note’s
anchor, i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[[#1a1a1|Link to other note]]&lt;/code&gt;. Pressing enter when the cursor is
over the link in normal mode will jump to that note. The structure of the
Zettelkasten IDs make it easy to find a note’s ID when putting in a link – searching
for a general term associated with the desired note will lead to its parent note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zettelkasten method has allowed me to start organizing my thoughts into a
digital “second brain”, and using Vim and Vimwiki for editing makes it easy to
scale with my rapidly increasing set of notes. My notes are in plain-text and
backed up in multiple places, so I don’t need to worry about vendor lock-in and
losing my notes. Using Zettelkasten with Vimwiki is just enough structure and tech
to make notetaking enjoyable, but not so much that it builds a fragile, short-lived
tech stack.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Code Ahead - A Painful Read That Makes Some Valid Points</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/02/28/code-ahead.html"/>
   <updated>2020-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/02/28/code-ahead</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/codeahead.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-ahead---a-painful-read-that-makes-some-valid-points&quot;&gt;Code Ahead - A Painful Read That Makes Some Valid Points&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t like Yegor Bugayenko. The author of Code Ahead, a semi-autobiographical take on software engineering, comes across a condescending and annoying. The book’s protagonist is clearly modeled after the author, and  he sucks. The protagonist plays a know-it-all, a nihilist, and a caricature of  the author’s ideas. This creates a perfect storm of behavior that led to my  hatred of the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the book makes some good points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-performance&quot;&gt;Tracking Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme in Code Ahead is performance tracking. Management rightfully wants a reliable metric for a programmer’s productivity, but that is not an easy ask. The protagonist argues for using closed tickets for tracking productivity. I agree with the core idea of this method. I do not, however, agree with the author’s hypothetical scenario where programmers are paid as a function of their closed tickets. This payment structure is one of the many examples of  the author’s cold, simplistic view on software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting discussion between the book’s characters on whether this method of tracking performance is &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt;. It is another process, after all, and it introduces a risk of the team’s programmer’s becoming feature factories. This is another reason that I do not agree with the author’s suggestion to pay developers by their number of completed tickets; pushing one metric too hard will inevitably lead to the team becoming one dimensional in pursuit of the  metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The QA team in Code Ahead has a metric that is roughly the opposite of the developers’ metric – tickets opened. This is the opposite of the conventional team structure, but I am of the opinion that it is the correct approach. The QA team should be rewarded for finding defects in their testing. It is cheaper and faster to  fix bugs found before they reach the customer. Additionally, the QA team would have no tangible effect on the organization if their tests are always passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-definition-of-done&quot;&gt;The Definition of “Done”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related question to the decision of what metric to track is the decision of  when to consider a ticket complete. This definition of “done” varies between  teams and is often the source of a lot of bugs and team conflicts. The  protagonist in Code Ahead rightly points out that this definition should be  very clearly understood by the team and its stakeholders. His recommended approach for making this clear to the team is to have the team decide on their definition as a group. I think this would be appropriate most of the team, but if a team has a lot of stakeholders with complex requirements then the average developer may not be able to make an informed opinion on what must constitute as “done”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bugayenko-the-egoist&quot;&gt;Bugayenko the Egoist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for my dislike of Bugayenko is his character’s Egoistic attitude. The beginning suggests to get a role where you can wield power over your coworkers without holding any real responsibility. The protagonist is playing “poker with Tony for a place in the hierarchy” while taking a software architect role for the supposed lack of responsibility with the position. Bugayenko says that his  goal with his role is to work exclusively on his own open-source projects while receiving a paycheck, bending his coworkers to his ideals, and incessantly  quoting Nietzche throughout. Seriously, the guy needs to stop with the appeals to Nietzche and other philosophers.  ## TL;DR I like the points that the Code Ahead made, but I don’t think I actually &lt;em&gt;enjoyed&lt;/em&gt; reading the book. I would recommend reading about the book’s main discussion points elsewhere; it’s not worth the ~$40 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>~ as Home does not work in MacOS .zshrc</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/08/zshrc-macos.html"/>
   <updated>2020-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/08/zshrc-macos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up a 2015 MBP to use as a development machine for my side
project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://autodo.app&quot;&gt;auToDo&lt;/a&gt;, since Apple won’t let you make iOS apps without a Mac. I’m
not thrilled to be developing on a platform other than my beloved &lt;a href=&quot;https://system76.com/pop&quot;&gt;Pop! OS&lt;/a&gt;,
but it’s at least still a *nix based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see that, as of Catalina, MacOS uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zsh.org/&quot;&gt;Zsh&lt;/a&gt; as its default shell.
I use Zsh as my default shell on my linux machine so I was excited to simply
drop in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file from the linux machine. For the most part that worked,
after installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ohmyz.sh/&quot;&gt;Oh-My-Zsh&lt;/a&gt; and the other usual things, but running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flutter&lt;/code&gt;
did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a bit of an issue since the MacBook’s main purpose in life was to be a
flutter dev machine. I spent about half an hour verifying that I had all of the
proper executables installed for Flutter and that they had the right permissions,
only to realize that the issue was very simple but not immediately obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; symbol does not expand to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/{USER_NAME}/&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file on MacOS
like it does in Pop! OS. I had been using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; symbol to point to the location
of the flutter binaries on my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;, which worked on my linux machine but not
on the MacBook. I changed these symbols to the full &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/{USER_NAME}/&lt;/code&gt; string
in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and everything worked fine and dandy for Flutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be like me, use full paths in your Mac’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alpaca Keyboards Hot Dox Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/09/16/hotdox-review.html"/>
   <updated>2019-09-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2019/09/16/hotdox-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/keyboard1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image keyboard photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/&quot;&gt;Hot Dox&lt;/a&gt; keyboard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/&quot;&gt;Alpaca Keyboards&lt;/a&gt; as my introduction to the world of split ergonomic keyboards. My primary goals in moving from a traditional mechanical keyboard were to get an improvement in ergonomics and to get much more customization potential than I had with my current keyboards. The Hot Dox is acceptable on the ergonomics front and excellent on the customization front due to its use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qmk.fm/&quot;&gt;QMK Firmware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ergonomics&quot;&gt;Ergonomics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of the Hot Dox differs in many ways from a traditional keyboard and, in my opinion, those differences are largely for the better. The Hot Dox is a clone of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ergodox-ez.com/&quot;&gt;Ergodox&lt;/a&gt; keyboard, which is described as an &lt;em&gt;ortholinear, split keyboard&lt;/em&gt;. For those who aren’t familiar, I’ll break down those adjectives individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ortholinear&quot;&gt;Ortholinear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;ortholinear&lt;/em&gt; keyboard is a keyboard where each of the keys are grouped in straight columns rather than in a staggered layout like a traditional keyboard. In my experience it is a surprisingly different experience to type on an ortholinear keyboard compared to a traditional; the keys are only moved a tiny bit on the keyboard but forcing the keys into perfect columns drastically changed the way my fingers moved to hit most keys. Hitting keys that are not on home row is achieved through a linear movement of the corresponding typing finger and there is no need for a change in hand orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of months with my Hot Dox I still can’t claim to be completely used to this new layout, but it makes a lot more sense than a staggered layout. It seems to me like a milder version of switching to a non-traditional layout like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard&quot;&gt;Dvorak&lt;/a&gt;– while there are pros to the changed layout, one will likely always have times when the have to switch back to a traditional layout. I have not had too hard of a time making the mental switch associated with using a traditional keyboard some times and the ortholinear layout at other times, but it is definitely still noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;split&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;split&lt;/em&gt; keyboard is very easily noticeable as such, the halves of the keyboard associated with each typing hand are, well, split apart. The main benefit of this design is ergonomics; it is a lot more natural to have your arms sitting even with your shoulders than to stick your hands in line with the middle of your ribcage like with a traditional keyboard. I don’t have any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury&quot;&gt;RSI&lt;/a&gt; issues with my hands to combat so I don’t have a huge need for the improved ergonomics but it helps me rest easier knowing that I’m doing less harm to my body by typing for so many hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One somewhat unintended benefit of the split layout is forcing good habit when typing. I had previously been pretty bad about moving my hands around the keyboard and off of home row but with the split keyboard it’s impossible to accidentally start typing on the wrong hand’s side of the keyboard. I’ve noticed that this has improved my typing form on traditional keyboards as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;qmk&quot;&gt;QMK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;QMK Firmware&lt;/em&gt; is without a doubt my favorite part of using this keyboard. This firmware allows you to change the behavior of every key on the keyboard to fit your preferences. The modifications to the key behavior is not restricted simply to the standard set of keys that can be accessed without holding any modifier keys, instead you can add up to 32 &lt;strong&gt;layers&lt;/strong&gt; of different functionality. A layer is similar to the change from lowercase to uppercase that occurs when holding the shift key. I have one layer that allows me to use the arrow keys on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i, j, k, l&lt;/code&gt; keys so I don’t have to move from home row, another layer that allows me to move the mouse with the same set of keys, and another layer that gives me a numpad around home row position. These layers give me all of the benefits of a full-size keyboard (plus some, in the case of the mouse keys) without ever having to leave home row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find my QMK configuration file on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baylessj/hotdox-qmk&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tenting-modification&quot;&gt;Tenting Modification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/keyboard2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image tented keyboard macro shot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made one minor modification to my assembly of the keyboard that has made a decent improvement in my impression of its ergonomics. One popular configuration with split keyboards is a &lt;em&gt;tented&lt;/em&gt; configuration where the inside edge of each of the keyboard halves is raised somewhat. This puts your hands at a slight angle, which is a more natural way for them to sit. Some keyboards allow this behavior by default, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ergodox-ez.com/&quot;&gt;Ergodox&lt;/a&gt;, but the Hot Dox does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For $4 and a trip to the hardware store, however, I was able to easily achieve some slight tenting to my keyboard. I got a set of 3mm x 16mm button head screw with a 2mm drive and a 3mm - 0.5 hex nut for each of the screws. I replaced the screws holding together the case on the inside corners with these longer screws, adjusted the hex nuts snug against the case, and had a nice tented keyboard setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall-impressions&quot;&gt;Overall Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the switch to a split, ortholinear keyboard has been a difficult transition, but I’ve found that this keyboard makes it well worth it. My typing ability has improved on other keyboards as well, but the flexibility with the QMK Firmware allows me to be my most productive on this keyboard. 10/10 – get a cool keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gradle Configuration for Firebase Usage in Flutter</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/07/flutter-firebase-gradle.html"/>
   <updated>2019-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2019/08/07/flutter-firebase-gradle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently got started developing a cross-platform app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.dev/&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, a framework developed by Google that uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dart.dev/&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; programming language. One major benefit of the fact that Flutter is created by Google is the &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; easy integration with Google’s other services. I have come across one minor exception to this rule in my attempt to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt; with my Flutter project, an error regarding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;original-gradle-modifications&quot;&gt;Original Gradle Modifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed along with Google’s guide on modifying my app’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradle.org/&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; configuration files to integrate Firebase services into the app. My Gradle config files after implementing the Google guide’s changes were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./android/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.2.1'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.0'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}

rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = &quot;${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}&quot;
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./android/app/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def localProperties = new Properties()
def localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file('local.properties')
if (localPropertiesFile.exists()) {
    localPropertiesFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader -&amp;gt;
        localProperties.load(reader)
    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException(&quot;Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.&quot;)
}

def flutterVersionCode = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionCode')
if (flutterVersionCode == null) {
    flutterVersionCode = '1'
}

def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
if (flutterVersionName == null) {
    flutterVersionName = '1.0'
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply from: &quot;$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle&quot;

android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId &quot;com.jonathanbayless.autodo&quot;
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 28
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
        testInstrumentationRunner &quot;android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner&quot;
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
            // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
    }
}

flutter {
    source '../..'
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.2'
    androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.2'
}

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'  // Google Play services Gradle plugin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-many-methods-for-one-dex-file&quot;&gt;Too many methods for one Dex file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I was done following the Google guide I was met with a build error that was not addressed in the Google guide. The addition of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google-services&lt;/code&gt; package inflated the size of the built project to the point that it exceeded the number of methods allowed in a single &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file is similar to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; file from typical Java development but is unique to the Android ecosystem. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file is used as an intermediary file in developing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; file that will be loaded onto the Android device. I discovered through this error message that the default Gradle configuration generated with Flutter only uses one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file to generate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I found to this error consisted of two changes: enabling a build flag regarding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; generation and enabling resource shrinking. The default configuration that only allows for one &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; file can be changed by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;multiDexEnabled&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;defaultConfig&lt;/code&gt; section of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;android&lt;/code&gt; rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;defaultConfig {
    applicationId &quot;com.jonathanbayless.autodo&quot;

    multiDexEnabled true

    versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
    versionName flutterVersionName
    testInstrumentationRunner &quot;android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first change alone will solve the build errors, but I was frustrated with the massive increase in size of my application when I was only using a small portion of the Firebase feature set. There are two additional flags available to reduce the size of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.dex&lt;/code&gt; files and resulting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.apk&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shrinkResources&lt;/code&gt; flag removes unnecessary code that comes by default with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google-services&lt;/code&gt; package and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minifyEnabled&lt;/code&gt; just removes any dead code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;buildTypes {
    release {
        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug

        shrinkResources true
        minifyEnabled true

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mix of these three flags reduced the size of my application and got it back to being able to compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resulting-gradle-file&quot;&gt;Resulting Gradle File&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./android/&lt;/code&gt; Gradle config file was not changed at all, it was the same as in the original example. Here is the modified &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./android/app/&lt;/code&gt; Gradle file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def localProperties = new Properties()
def localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file('local.properties')
if (localPropertiesFile.exists()) {
    localPropertiesFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader -&amp;gt;
        localProperties.load(reader)
    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException(&quot;Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.&quot;)
}

def flutterVersionCode = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionCode')
if (flutterVersionCode == null) {
    flutterVersionCode = '1'
}

def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
if (flutterVersionName == null) {
    flutterVersionName = '1.0'
}
