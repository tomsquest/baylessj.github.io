I'm a big fan of side-projects and I've run a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
site as my personal site for a while now, so it seemed inevitable that I would take
advantage of its blogging capabilities at some point.

I have a number of fun new projects in the works now, hopefully I'll be able
to put together some nice articles on those in the near future.
